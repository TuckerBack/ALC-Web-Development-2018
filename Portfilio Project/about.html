        <p id="FirstP">My name is Tucker Back. I have been in a Digital Media class and a Web Development class for the last year and have learned a ton of stuff. I have learned how to use Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrador, Adobe Animate, and Audacity in my Digital Media class. In my Web Development class I have gotten a lot of experience with Html and Css. I have learned how to use Flex and how to set up a basic website. Over the year I have made a lot of stuff through out the year. I have did some Photoshop projects where I put things into a picture and other ones where I changed the faces of people on some posters. Then I learned how to design logos and icons in Illustrador. I learned how to make animations and made some cool animations in Animate. And I have learned how to add sound effects to audio in Audiacity. Then for my Web Development class I have made a bunch of different websites. Some that were used to learn how to do certain things. I have learned a lot over this last year.</p>
