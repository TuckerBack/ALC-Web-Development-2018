        <p>My name is Tucker Back. I have been in a Digital Media class and a Web Development class for the last year and have learned a ton of stuff. I have learned how to use Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrador, Adobe Animate, and Audacity in my Digital Media class. In my Web Development class I have gotten a lot of experience with Html and Css. I have learned how to use Flex and how to set up a basic website. Over the year I have made a lot of stuff through out the year. I have done a couple of diffrent Photoshop projects. I put things into a picture and I changed the face of people on some posters.</p>
